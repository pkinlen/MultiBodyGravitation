# MultiBodyGravitation
Evaluating how multiple bodies move when there is a gravitational attraction between the bodies.

Given initial positions and velocities, the code will work out the paths taken by the bodies.

The code can be used to evaluate the paths taken by a meteorite, the sun, the planets and some moons.
